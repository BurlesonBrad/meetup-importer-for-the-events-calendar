## Description ##

Automatically import events from Meetup.com into The Events Calendar.

To get started, make sure that you have The Events Calendar plugin (by Modern Tribe) installed. This plugin will not do anything without it!

After you have both plugins installed, navigate to Events -> Import in your Dashboard, and click on the "Meetup.com" tab. From there you only need to fill in the URL for a Meetup group, select the Event Categories you want it to be mapped to, and hit "Add Recurring Import". This will schedule a script to run twice a day to import the upcoming events from that group into The Events Calendar.

A few notes:

**This is an early release of this plugin, so it's a little barebones. Help make it better by contributing yourself - see below!**

### Contributing ###

You can contribute to development of the plugin on [Github](https://github.com/dabernathy89/meetup-importer-for-the-events-calendar/). Please don't use the repo for technical support. Pull requests will be welcomed for bug fixes and other improvements. Let me know before you start developing a new feature so that we can discuss it.

This plugin is built using the `generator-plugin-wp` Yo generator built by WebDevStudios.
